            <p>Today I set my computer up. I installed Visual Studio Code and Google Chrome.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>I did research on Visual Studio Code. I reviewed sample projects</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Visual Studio Code is a fast, lightweight and free tool that can run on Microsoft, Linux and Mac operating systems.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>VS Code is one step ahead of its competitors in terms of speed, according to the sources I have read. One of the most important reasons for this to be so was that he used a different text editor. This editor is a browser based monaco text editor developed by Microsoft.</p>

            <p>Html is the system used in the preparation of web pages. Html, which is not a programming language, is used in the creation of websites that we use on our computers. Browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer process html codes and convert these codes into web pages.</p>

            <p>In a universe where the Earth is sharply divided into destruction and progress, people have a chance to be on the "good side". However, only 3% of the participants can successfully use this chance.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>These series are actually a harsh reflection of the real life we ​​live in. Aren't we struggling to be among that elite 3%? Although this struggle is not often with a mind game, it is a tough struggle. In real life, this 3% almost does not change and continues with blood ties. A few people can get there. We continue this game by saying that the man worked and did it. We are an extra, with rules and scripts written.</p>

            <p>I learned many tags, attirubutes and elements that I have not used before. It was a very useful expression. Also, the education being in English was good for improving ourselves. I tried to use many Html codes I learned on my blog.</p>

            <p>Today I made a 3-week study plan. I have to schedule the day to be more planned and disciplined. During the day, I made a planning on 45 minutes of English word study, 3 episodes without English subtitles, 1 hour of Html-Css-Javascript code experiment, following and doing work related to tasks, 1 hour of cycling and daily routines.</p>
